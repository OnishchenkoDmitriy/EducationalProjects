Our story today is called "The Open Boat".  It was written by Stephen Crane and is based on what really happened to him in 1896.

Crane was traveling from the United States to Cuba as a newspaper reporter.  One night, his ship hit a sandbar.  It sank in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Florida.  Most of the people on board got into lifeboats.  Crane was among the last to leave.  There were three others with him: the ship's captain, the cook, and a sailor.

These four men climbed into the only remaining lifeboat.  The boat was so small that no one believed it could stay afloat for very long.  None of the four men thought he would ever reach the shore.  But the men fought the seas bravely, with all their strength.  Would they finally reach land?
